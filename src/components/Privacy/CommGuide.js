                <p id='commP'>These Community Guidelines set forth the type of conduct and decorum expected of all participants of the Mercado.studio. The Mercado.studio team is dedicated to building an ecosystem that empowers artists and collectors to connect with one another, collaborate, and participate in a new, natively digital art economy. But we cannot do it without your help. In the interest of keeping this community an open environment and ensuring the economic growth of the Mercado.studio marketplace, we’ve put together these Community Guidelines to help foster a Platform that can support all of us as creators, art enthusiasts, and friends.</p>
                <h2 id='commH2'>We’re asking you to:</h2>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Respect Other Community Members.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>A strong community is built on respect, so please keep all conversations civil and constructive. The crypto art community by and large is filled with artists and collectors who celebrate, inspire, and mentor creativity, talent, and innovation. We understand that like most crypto and art communities, the Mercado.studio community is not without disagreement or debate. Keep all discourse civil, open-minded, and respectful.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Avoid Harassment, Hate Speech, and Violence.</h5>
                <p id='commP'> Do not harass, bully, impersonate, or intimidate anyone in the Mercado.studio community. Mercado.studio has a zero-tolerance policy towards attacking or harassing a person or group based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. We will not tolerate users who persistently harass, threaten violence, or use hate speech against other users or community members.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Resolve Your Own Personal Disputes.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>We encourage people to resolve their own personal disputes with other community members in a respectful, honest, and well-intentioned manner. In the interest of preserving an open, unbiased, and transparent community, the Mercado.studio Team will not involve itself or weigh in on or resolve interpersonal disputes or disagreements, Twitter wars, or debates about art or cryptocurrency.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Not Give Power to Hate.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>Do not promote, support, or glorify hateful or extremist ideologies, such as white supremacist or other terrorist groups. Do not use hate speech or symbols, like swastikas, the white power hand sign, racial slurs, or any other hateful factional or derisive signaling of any kind. Respect Privacy.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Respect Privacy.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>Respect other people’s privacy and protect your own. Do not publicly share private or personally-identifying information. This includes, but is not limited to, personal contact details, contact addresses, and private correspondence, including private correspondence between you and the Mercado.studio team.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Protect Your Keys.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>Always protect your Ethereum private key and back it up somewhere offline. Mercado.studio team members will never ask you for your private keys or any other personal info. If anyone asks you to send ETH or tokens, it's most likely a scam. Be smart and stay safe.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Respect the Artists.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>The artists are the ones who make the magic happen, so be respectful to all Mercado.studio artists even if you are not a fan of their work. Mercado.studio community members are the new tastemakers of the digital art future, so it is completely fine (and encouraged!) to comment on or criticize Mercado.studio artists or artwork for the purpose of discussion. However, you should not publicly disparage or target a specific artist with the intention of interfering with his or her ability to sell works, promote artwork, or receive a fair price for a particular transaction.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Share, Link, and Provide Attribution.</h5>
                <p id='commP'> Sharing is caring. We at Mercado.studio believe that more eyes on Mercado.studio artwork benefits the community as a whole. When sharing Mercado.studio artworks online, you should always provide a link to the artwork on the Mercado.studio website. This ensures that the artist will always receive recognition and credit for his or her creative efforts. </p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Do Not Spam.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>Mercado.studio is not a venue for you to post unsolicited or duplicate ads for products and services. You know what spamming is.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Respect Intellectual Property.</h5>
                <p id='commP'> Mercado.studio is a marketplace for authentic and original digital art. Our Terms of Service expressly forbid artists from posting unauthorized, copied, or otherwise unoriginal content. Mercado.studio artists should especially refrain from posting, repurposing, or remixing the work of other Mercado.studio artists without permission. If you are unsure as to whether or not an artwork is a prohibited reproduction of someone else’s work, then do not tokenize it.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Monitor your Content.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>All artists should monitor their own art for infringing content before minting a token to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the Marketplace. Our Terms of Service expressly require artist to represent that their works contain no infringing or unauthorized material. We have no power to prevent an infringing work from being minted, but we do have the power to take down infringing works or remove artists from our community for repeatedly posting infringing content.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Keep the Marketplace Fair.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>The integrity of the Marketplace depends on the honest, open, and fair market activity of all Users. Users are forbidden from engaging in sham transactions, wash trading, fraud, price pumping, price-fixing, sham bidding, or any other type of market manipulation or anti-competitive conduct. Users are forbidden from, without limitation, selling works to themselves, creating fictitious accounts to bid on work for the purpose of influencing its market price or transferring works to other wallets controlled by the User or other conspirators to devalue or overvalue the work or works created by a particular artist.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Use the Marketplace to Buy Art... and Nothing Else.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>Mercado.studio is a place for artwork transactions, and not a place for illicit economic activity. Users are expressly forbidden from engaging into any transaction on the Mercado.studio Marketplace for the purpose of concealing economic activity not relating to artwork transactions. For example, and without limitation, Users are forbidden from using the Marketplace to launder money, conceal or transfer proceeds relating to criminal activity, or to make payments to people for consideration other than a Mercado.studio artwork.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Follow the Law.</h5>
                <p id='commP'>It is your responsibility to know your local laws and any other legal regulations that might apply to your participation in the Mercado.studio community. If you're wondering if it’s illegal, then it probably doesn’t have a place within Mercado.studio. We love creative freedom and have spent years building tools to support creative expression. Please don’t use the Mercado.studio Platform for evil.</p>

                <h5 id='commH5'>Join the Conversation.</h5>
